# Surveillance Detection Scout: Your Lookout on Autopilot  
Surveillance Detection Scout is a hardware and software stack that makes use of your Tesla's cameras to tell you if you're being followed in real-time. The name, as you likely gathered, pays homage to the ever-effective "Surveillance Detection Route". When parked, Scout makes an excellent static surveillance practitioner as well, allowing you to run queries and establish patterns-of-life on detected persons.

Before going any further, I want to make sure to acknowledge the people (and repositories) who helped this project, without knowing they did so.  
1. TeslaUSB (https://github.com/marcone/teslausb).   
2. ALPR-Unconstrained (https://github.com/sergiomsilva/alpr-unconstrained).  
3. Facenet (found at https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet).  
4. The whole team at Tevora (https://threat.tevora.com).  
  
## Information  
Scout is a simple to install, and simple to use tool for analyzing video data from Tesla Model S, 3 and X camera feeds.  
  
Scout is intended to be built on an Nividia Jetson Xavier to Nano, but you may use a Raspberry Pi 4 if real time notification isn't a priority.
